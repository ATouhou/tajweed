## Tajweed Highlighting Experiments

بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم
*In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful*

The purpose of this project is to experiment with "tajweed syntax highlighting,"
or writing algorithms to color code the various tajweed rules as is found in
the tajweed mus7af.

If Allah makes it easy and things go well, the idea is that the output from
this project can be used by many projects.
